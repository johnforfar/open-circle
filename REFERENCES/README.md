# REFERENCES

This folder contains reference code, submodules, and external repositories used for development and inspiration.

**Note:** This entire folder is gitignored and will not be committed to the repository.

## Contents

- `base44-design/` - Design system and component references
- `landing-page/` - Landing page reference implementation (submodule)
- `openrd/` - OpenR&D smart contract references
- `xnode-nextjs-template/` - Xnode Next.js template reference

## Usage

These are reference materials only. Do not modify code in this directory directly - use them as inspiration for the main `nextjs-app/` codebase.

## Submodules

If you need to initialize the submodule (for local reference only):

```bash
# Note: This won't work since REFERENCES/ is gitignored
# Submodules in ignored directories cannot be initialized
# Use the original repositories directly if needed
```
